# Code Dedup

Carefully search for duplicate code, duplicate tests, and dead code across the repo. Merge duplicates and delete dead code — but only when test coverage proves the change is safe.

> **Repo context — READ THIS FIRST.** `eleventy-plugin-techdoc` is **plain, untyped JavaScript (ES modules, Node >= 18)** — there is no TypeScript, no `tsconfig.json`, and no static type checker. The source lives in `lib/` (`lib/index.js`, `lib/filters/`, `lib/plugins/`, `lib/shortcodes/`, `lib/virtual-templates.js`), the CLI in `bin/init.js`, plus `templates/` (`.njk`) and `assets/` (`css/`, `js/`). Tests are **Playwright** e2e run via `make test` (driving `sample_website/`); lint is `make lint` (ESLint + Prettier check + Shipwright manifest validation). The coverage gate reads `coverage-thresholds.json` inside `make test`. Because the codebase is **untyped JavaScript**, the hard gate below (Prerequisite 3) forces this skill to **REFUSE to dedup**. Do not work around that gate.

## Prerequisites — hard gate

Before touching ANY code, verify these conditions. If any fail, stop and report why.

1. Run `make test` — the CLI version contract, all Playwright e2e tests, and the coverage gate must pass. If anything fails, stop. Do not dedup a broken codebase. (Note: `make test` only runs Playwright when the `tests/` and `sample_website/` fixtures exist; if they are absent there is no e2e coverage at all, so dedup is not safe — stop.)
2. Re-confirm the green baseline from `make test`. The coverage gate reads `coverage-thresholds.json` (`default_threshold` is currently `0` because per-line instrumentation is not wired yet — Playwright e2e is the only coverage). A `0%` floor means the gate cannot catch a coverage regression, which makes silent breakage even harder to detect. Treat the effectively-absent coverage floor as a reason to be _more_ conservative, not less.
3. Verify the project uses **static typing**. This repo is **untyped JavaScript**, so: **STOP. Refuse to dedup.** Print exactly:
   > "This codebase has no static type checking. Deduplication without types is reckless — too high a risk of silent breakage. Add type checking first."
4. **Confirm the deslop MCP server is available** (see "Required tooling" below). The deslop `language` filter supports only `csharp`, `rust`, and `python` — it does **not** support JavaScript. So even setting aside Prerequisite 3, a real structural duplicate scan is not available for this repo; any scan would be best-effort grep only. See the fallback rule under "Required tooling".

## Required tooling — the deslop MCP server

This skill is built around the **deslop** MCP server. **Supported languages: `csharp`, `rust`, `python` only.** For a JavaScript project like this one, deslop's clustering is **not available**; you MUST report this limitation up front rather than pretending you ran a real duplicate scan. Fall back to careful symbol-level grep and ESLint output, and clearly label the scan as "best-effort, no deslop".

When deslop is available for a supported language, the canonical workflow calls these tools in order: `mcp__deslop__session-config` → `mcp__deslop__rescan` → `mcp__deslop__top-offenders` → `mcp__deslop__report-query` → `mcp__deslop__cluster-by-id` → `mcp__deslop__report-for-file` / `mcp__deslop__report-for-range` → `mcp__deslop__find-similar` (before writing any replacement) → `mcp__deslop__rescan` (after each change). **None of that applies here because this repo is JavaScript** — deslop cannot index it.

**Bucket interpretation (for reference only):** `identical` > `nearly_identical` > `loosely_similar` > `same_behavior`.

## Steps

For THIS repo, the hard gate at Prerequisite 3 means the only correct outcome is to **refuse and report**. The steps below describe the general procedure; do not execute the mutating steps on this untyped-JavaScript codebase.

```
Dedup Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Prerequisites evaluated (tests green? typed? deslop supported?) — for this repo: untyped JS → REFUSE
- [ ] Step 2: Dead code scan (best-effort, no deslop) — report only, do not delete
- [ ] Step 3: Duplicate code scan (no deslop for JS) — report only, do not merge
- [ ] Step 4: Duplicate test scan (no deslop for JS) — report only, do not delete
- [ ] Step 5: SKIPPED — refusing to mutate untyped JavaScript
- [ ] Step 6: SKIPPED
```

### Step 1 — Inventory test coverage

1. Run `make test` to confirm a green Playwright baseline. The recorded coverage floor is the `default_threshold` from `coverage-thresholds.json` (currently `0`, since per-line instrumentation is not wired yet).
2. Identify which files/modules in `lib/`, `bin/`, `templates/`, and `assets/` are exercised by the e2e tests in `tests/`. Only files exercised by tests are even candidates for dedup — and even then, see the untyped-JS refusal.

### Step 2 — Scan for dead code (best-effort, report only)

Search for code that is never called, never imported, never referenced.

1. Look for unused exports, unused functions, unused variables in `lib/`, `bin/init.js`, and `assets/js/`.
2. Use ESLint output where available (`npx eslint .`) — it flags unused variables/imports.
3. For each candidate: **grep the entire codebase** for references (including `tests/`, `templates/*.njk`, `sample_website/`, config files). Only mark as dead if truly zero references. Remember `.njk` templates reference filters/shortcodes/collections by string name, and `assets/` JS is loaded by templates — a symbol with zero JS-import references may still be live via a template.
4. List all dead code found with file paths and line numbers. Do NOT delete (untyped JS → refusing to mutate).

### Step 3 — Scan for duplicate code (best-effort, no deslop)

deslop does not support JavaScript, so state that up front and run a **best-effort** scan only: symbol-level grep for repeated function/method bodies across `lib/` and `bin/init.js`, plus ESLint output. Flag every finding as `(no-deslop fallback)`. Do NOT merge anything — untyped JS.

### Step 4 — Scan for duplicate tests (best-effort, no deslop)

Best-effort grep across `tests/**/*.spec.js` for near-identical Playwright test bodies. Flag findings as `(no-deslop fallback)`. Do NOT delete anything — untyped JS.

### Step 5 — Apply changes

**SKIPPED for this repo.** Untyped JavaScript fails the Prerequisite 3 hard gate; do not remove dead code, merge duplicates, or delete duplicate tests.

### Step 6 — Final verification

Not applicable — no changes were made. Re-running `make lint` and `make test` should show the same green baseline as Step 1.

## Rules

- **Untyped code = refuse to dedup.** This repo is untyped JavaScript, which is too dangerous to dedup. Types are the safety net that catches breakage at compile time; without them, silent runtime errors are near-certain. This is the governing rule for this repo.
- **Deslop does not support JavaScript = best-effort scan, declared up front.** Say so in the first message of any report and label every finding as `(no-deslop fallback)`. Never pretend a structural scan ran.
- **No test coverage = do not touch.** If a file is not exercised by the e2e tests, leave it alone entirely.
- **Coverage must not drop.** The `coverage-thresholds.json` floor is `0` (no per-line instrumentation), so the gate cannot prove coverage stayed flat — another reason to refuse mutation.
- **One change at a time.** (Only relevant on a typed repo.) Make one dedup change, run `make test`, verify, never batch.
- **When in doubt, leave it.** False dedup is worse than duplication.
- **Preserve public API surface.** Do not change exported plugin/filter/shortcode/collection names or the CLI's behavior — sites and the scaffolder depend on them. `.njk` templates and `sample_website/` bind to these by name.
- **Three similar lines is fine.** Do not abstract trivial duplication. Only substantial shared logic (>10 lines) or 3+ copies would ever justify a merge — and even then, not on untyped JS.
